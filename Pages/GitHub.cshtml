                    <b>ColinScripts - Python</b>.<br />Python was one of the first programming languages that I learned. 
                    I still occasionally use python for some home projects, such as on my Raspberry Pi and personal computer. The Python folder is 
                    broken down in to three sub folders, IT Service Desk, Utility, and Raspberry Pi. Each containing relevant scripts.

                    <b>ColinScripts - AutoHotKey</b>.<br />All my AutoHotKey scripts come from when I was working on the IT Service Desk.
                    The main script here is the ITSDUtil. A friend and I were able to build a toolbar for everyone on the IT Service Desk to use. 
                    This toolbar provided most of the information you regularly need, right at your finger tips. Everything from finding solutions 
                    to common problems, to unlocking accounts and changing passwords. Making all this information easily available helped to 
                    reduce call times and improve productivity across the IT Service Desk.

                    ITSDUtil to seamlessly interact with Active Directory. The abillity to get account information and change account information
                    all in one place saved time for all IT Service Desk agents.

                    to be in. When calculating you'll have two options. You can choose Calculate or Advanced Calculate. Calculate will return 
                    the answer as a decimal of the output unit. Advanced calculate will break down the answer into time units so you can see 
                    exactly how many hours, minutes, seconds, etc. it will be.

                    my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist. The function is set on a timer trigger that runs once a week. It is set to 
                    run at 2AM UTC every Sunday. Once kicked off the function interacts with the Spotify APIs to get and set data. 
                    The function starts off by getting all the playlists listed under my account. After that it finds the IDs for my 
                    Discover Weekly and Discover Last Weekly playlist. It then gets all the tracks from my Discover Weekly playlist 
                    and puts them in my Discover Last Weekly playlist by replacing what is currently there. By doing all of this I have 
                    one more week to go through my music and save off the songs that I enjoyed.
