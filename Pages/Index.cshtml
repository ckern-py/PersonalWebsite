                    My name is Colin Kern. I am currenlty a programmer in the insurance industry. I have been working as a programer for the past
                    @programYears years. I started out writing scritps while working Tech Support. You can check out my scripts and other projects
                    I've worked on by visiting my GitHub Projects page, <a asp-page="/GitHub">or by clicking here</a>.
                    My scripts are a mix of Python, Powershell, and AutoHotKey. All the other projects are written in C#.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am most experienced in .NET languages such as C# and Visual Basic, as that is what I spend most of my day interacting with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa in May 2017 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Management Information
                    Systems (MIS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not programming you'll probably find me in the gym, or on the courts playing Pickleball.

                <b>Programming</b>.<br />
                I started out my post college carreer working in Tech Support, on the IT Service Desk. It was there that
                I taught myself my first programming language, Python. After learning Python I was presented opportuniites on the IT Service Desk
                to learn other scripting languages, like AutoHotKey and Powershell. After a few years of doing scripting languages I decided to
                learn a new language, someting that was more object oriented. I decided to teach myself C#. So I spent the next few months doing
                online examples, reading lots of online documentation, and writing a few simple programs. With my new knowledge of C# I was able
                to get the Application Analyst job that I currently have. In this role I use C# and .NET all the time. Whether it's working on
                Azure hosted applications or developing on prem solutions.
