        Hello, and welcome to my website that I have built from the ground up using C# and Razor Pages.
    </p>
    <p>

        My name is Colin Kern. I have been working as a programer for the past @programYears years.
        I started out writing scritps work working Tech Support. You can check out my scripts here {LINK}. They consist of 3 primary languages. Python, Powershell, and AutoHotKey.

        I am most experienced in .NET languaes (C# and Visual Basic) but also have projects in Python and Powershell, as shown above.

        I graduated from Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa in 2017 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Management Information Systems (MIS).

        This website has GitHub links to some of the projects that I've done over the years.
