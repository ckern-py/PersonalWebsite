# PersonalWebsite
This is a repo containing a website I created that has information about me and the work I've done.

## Description
This repo contains a website I created for personal use that has information about me and the projects I've done. This is my first, and so far, only website. The website is built with NET Core 3.1. Since it is built with NET Core it mainly uses a C# and Razorpages foundation. The website contains a main page which give an overview of me and my career. It contains a Contact Me page where you can fill out a form and send me an email. Github Porjects is the main page. It contains links to GitHub projects that I have done over the years. As well as a brief description of each project.

The website its self is hosted in Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Docker Containers.

## Coming soon
More information and links to the site.
